  <h3>Site Overview</h3>
  <p>
    This site was initially created to showcase who I am beyond the limits of a CV.
    It now also serves another purpose: demonstrating my ability to learn new skills
    quickly and then apply them effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    With no prior experience in web development, I built this website from scratch
    using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I believe this website serves as a demonstration
    of my work ethic, adaptability, and determination to pursue a career in finance.

  <div class="achievement-body">
    <p>
      During this project, I processed and manipulated large datasets in Linux, exported key segments to Python, developed a new model variant from existing approaches, fitted the data with multiple models to extract parameters, and validated the results through statistical significance testing. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This required building a systematic filtering pipeline, handling noisy real-world data, comparing competing models, and assessing the robustness of any detected features. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The work strengthened my coding ability, statistical reasoning, data-cleaning workflow, and confidence working independently on a complex analytical problem from start to finish.

    <p>
      Although the project was astrophysical, the skill set is directly transferable to analyst roles.

      The workflow mirrors the process of evaluating trading signals: large-scale data handling, noise reduction, model comparison, parameter extraction, robustness testing, and avoiding false positives. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It taught me to be sceptical of “nice-looking” features, to validate results quantitatively, and to build analysis pipelines that can be repeated, adapted, and stress tested. The same mindset required for research, portfolio analysis, and quantitative decision-making in finance.

  <section id="highlighted-experiences">
    <h2><strong>Red Highlighted Experiences</strong></h2>

    <p>
      Two experiences above are highlighted red as they are the most directly relevant to the skills and mindset I believe are required for finance and analyst roles. Both provided hands-on exposure to data-driven decision making, performing under pressure, and environments where accuracy, reasoning, and clear communication really matter.
    </p>
    <p> 
      They represent the closest alignment between my academic background, technical ability, and my future direction in quantitative and investment-focused work

         INVESCO EXPERIENCE
         ======================== -->

    <h3 style="color:#e60000;">Invesco Experience Day – Detailed Summary</h3>

    <p>
      My experience day at Invesco gave me a close-up look at how a large asset manager operates on a day-to-day basis. I shadowed members of the trading desk, starting with observing their Bloomberg setup and the morning flow of research emails and market projections from banks. I sat in on a morning meeting between the Head Trader of EMEA Equities and Fund managers, which covered key market moves and positioning for the day, before returning to the desk to watch live trading and execution.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the most interesting parts of the day was seeing how portfolio managers communicate trade intentions to traders, and how those trades are then executed. I watched traders handle large orders, avoid conflicted counterparties, and balance speed versus price impact. Seeing how trades operate in person gave me a much clearer understanding of how real markets actually function.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also spent time speaking one-to-one with professionals across the firm, including a Senior Global Derivatives & FX Dealer, an Associate Analyst in Strategy and Execution, a Sustainable Investing Implementation Specialist, and a Junior Fixed Income Analyst. These conversations were some of the most enlightening parts of the day, giving me the chance to discuss routes into finance, practical advice on entering the industry, and the different paths available. They also helped fill in gaps in my understanding with insights from people working directly in those roles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, the day gave me exposure not just to market mechanics, but also to the working culture and expectations inside a large investment firm - an experience that has strengthened my motivation to pursue a role in finance.

    <!-- ===============================
         RESEARCH ASSISTANT EXPERIENCE
         =============================== -->

    <h3 style="color:#e60000;">Research Assistant – University of Southampton (Detailed Summary)</h3>

    <p>
      I was invited to undertake a funded eight-week research studentship after achieving 90% in my third-year final lab project. The project involved working with a hollow-fibre experimental set-up designed to operate under vacuum and cryogenic conditions - a complex setup that required careful optimisation and precision control.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the eight weeks, I gained a full understanding of the system, optimised light transmission through the fibre, and developed MATLAB control software for a nano-positioner used to house a sample. This included writing routines for positioning, calibration, and automated recall, as well as troubleshooting the hardware–software interface. Alongside this, I carried out signal checks, data collection and analysis, and solved unique problems requiring innovative thinking. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The placement strengthened several key skills:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Hands-on problem solving with complex physical systems</li>
      <li>MATLAB programming, automation, and hardware control</li>
      <li>Data-driven reasoning and iterative optimisation</li>
      <li>Working with vacuum and cryogenic equipment</li>
      <li>Communicating technical progress clearly to senior academics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I successfully delivered the optimised setup and the full control code by the project deadline. Based on my performance, the senior academic I was working under expressed interest in creating a PhD opportunity for me.

<h3>Finance Research Project</h3>

<p>
  The next major project I will be undertaking will be focused on finance.
  Coming from Physics, this project will aim to demonstrate the transferable
  skills I possess that are directly relevant to analyst roles.
</p>

<p>
  It will also allow me to deepen my understanding of the different areas of
  finance, the terminology used in industry, and the types of research and
  analysis expected in professional environments.
</p>

<p>
  I hope that this project will serve as strong evidence that I can be an
  asset to a company.

<h3>This Website</h3>

<p>
  I initially wanted to create a website to provide a deeper explanation of who I am and what I have
  done. A CV can only show so much, and many aspects of my experience, skills, and personality simply
  cannot be conveyed on a single sheet of paper.
</p>

<p>
  This website now also stands as a testament to my drive, determination, and adaptability. Once I
  decided to build it, I explored three different approaches:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Online website builders</strong> such as Wix, which allow you to assemble pages using
      standard visual tools.</li>
  <li><strong>AI-driven platforms</strong>, where a chatbot edits or generates the code behind the
      scenes.</li>
  <li><strong>Building a website entirely from scratch</strong>, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  To have full control over the structure, behaviour, and appearance of the site - and to challenge
  myself - I chose to build it from scratch.
</p>

<p>
  Starting from completely blank pages in TextEdit, I wrote the initial scripts needed to host a local
  test page. From there, every single line, colour, indent, layout choice, tab, and interactive element
  has been written by hand.
</p>

<div class="wavy-divider"></div>
<h4 class="project-subheading">Behind The Curtain </h4>
<p>
  This website runs on three programming languages which, before this project, I had never worked with.
  I now have a much deeper understanding of all three.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>HTML</strong> controls what appears on the screen, defining the main structure, layout, and content
  of each page.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>CSS</strong> controls the visual appearance, styling, and layout; including fonts, spacing,
  colours, the folder-style tabs, and responsive behaviour across different screen sizes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>JavaScript</strong> adds interactivity, such as the dynamic tab system and the clickable project
  boxes at the top of this section.
</p>


<p>
  For code snippets taken directly from the scripts behind this site, visit the
  <strong>Software</strong> tab and click on <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, or
  <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
</p>

<p><strong>Current script sizes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML – 955 lines</li>
  <li>CSS – 894 lines</li>
  <li>JavaScript – 33 lines</li>

<div class="wavy-divider"></div>

<!-- SECTION 1 – OVERVIEW -->
<section id="mp-overview">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">1 – Project Overview (Analytical Perspective)</h4>

  <p>
    From a data/analysis perspective, I wanted to take noisy astrophysical data, clean it, find key features,
    cut down the large dataset, fit with multiple models, compare model results, validate results
    statistically, interpret findings, and present results.
  </p>

  <p>
    In practical terms, a very interesting feature in the light curves (plotted intensity of an object against 
    time) had been observed twice in recent years, a apparent pause in counts during the rise phase of a burst. I was searching a very large database to find as many 
    examples of this feature as possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    To understand the pause feature, astronomers need much more information than two examples can provide. Questions 
    such as: How often does it appear? What conditions are necessary for the feature to be produced? Does it 
    appear every time? Is the feature real? What physics is at play to make the feature appear?  
    can only be answered when there are more examples to study.
  </p>

  <p>
    My project revolved around finding as many examples of this pause feature as possible, so future work could 
    potentially answer the questions above.
  </p>
</section>

<div class="wavy-divider"></div>

<!-- SECTION 2 – RESEARCH PHASE -->
<section id="mp-research">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">2 – Research Phase & Strategy</h4>

  <p>
    To begin the project, I conducted thorough research of academic papers and online material, searching for a 
    few key details:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Previous findings of the pause feature</li>
    <li>The physics at play</li>
    <li>Modelling methods</li>
    <li>Common approaches to presenting burst data</li>
    <li>Gaps and inconsistencies across papers</li>
    <li>Latest findings and studies</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I collected a significant number of papers, skimmed through to assess relevance to the areas above, flagged 
    papers by importance, printed key studies for closer assessment, and finally made bullet-point style notes.
  </p>

  <p>
    This phase was essential to the success of the project, as it allowed deeper understanding and previous work
    to guide the rest of the project.
  </p>
</section>

<div class="wavy-divider"></div>

<!-- SECTION 3 – DATA PIPELINE -->
<section id="mp-pipeline">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">3 – Data Pipeline Phase</h4>

  <p>
    Once 248 bursts (the pause feature happens during a burst) from 50 sources (i.e. stars) had been identified, I 
    employed the following systematic approach for handling data:
  </p>

  <img src="data-pipeline.jpg" class="software-images" alt="Data pipeline diagram">

  <p>
    Filter 1 represented removing bursts that could not be identified; Filter 2 was a quality assessment.  
    The quality assessment removed bursts for various reasons such as excessive noise, severe background 
    contamination, energy filtering suppressing the burst rise phase, or absence of a distinct burst signature.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the initial screening, I searched the remaining 65 bursts for any sign that the feature might be 
    present, and ended with 26 candidate bursts.
  </p>
</section>

<div class="wavy-divider"></div>

<!-- SECTION 4 – MODELLING -->
<section id="mp-modelling">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">4 – Modelling</h4>

  <p>
    The bursts were modelled using piecewise fitting. This effectively gets a computer program to trial 
    different lines and curves over the data and select the most accurate combination.
  </p>

  <p>
    In practice, the combinations of lines and curves have to be specified. The program is given an equation for each segment 
    (e.g. a straight line <em>y = m·x + c</em> or a power law <em>y = A·x<sup>k</sup></em>), and tries different 
    combinations of the variables <em>y, m, x, c, A, k</em>, constantly comparing which combination gave the 
    closest fit.
  </p>

  <p>
    The best fit was determined by calculating a chi-squared value, which measures how accurately a given line 
    represents the data it is covering.
  </p>

  <p>
    Four segments were defined in Python:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>1st Segment:</strong> models the background level of counts</li>
    <li><strong>2nd Segment:</strong> models the initial rise in counts</li>
    <li><strong>3rd Segment:</strong> models the feature I wanted to study</li>
    <li><strong>4th Segment:</strong> models the continued rise in counts after the feature</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Three different model variants were used, following the structure below:
  </p>

  <!-- MODEL VARIANT TABLE -->
  <h5 class="model-variant-title">Model Variants</h5>

  <table class="model-table">
    <tr>
      <th>Segment</th>
      <th>model S–S–S</th>
      <th>model P–S–S</th>
      <th>model S–S–P</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1st Segment</td>
      <td>Straight line</td>
      <td>Straight line</td>
      <td>Straight line</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2nd Segment</td>
      <td>Straight line</td>
      <td>Power law</td>
      <td>Straight line</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3rd Segment</td>
      <td>Straight line</td>
      <td>Straight line</td>
      <td>Straight line</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4th Segment</td>

<!-- 5 – TIME-BINNING -->
<section id="mp-timebinning">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">5 – Time-Binning & Mitigating Bias</h4>

  <p>
    Time-binning became one of the most important parts of the project, mainly because of how easily it
    could introduce subjectivity into the results. When plotting burst data, the choice of time bin directly
    affects the appearance of the light curve, how smooth or noisy it looks, and—critically—whether a pause
    is visible at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    To reduce the risk of “choosing” bins that supported the presence of a pause, I standardised the entire
    analysis to a bin size of <strong>0.01 s</strong>. This gave high time resolution and ensured all initial fits
    were performed consistently.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, using only one bin size still carried the risk that the results were influenced by the chosen
    resolution. To address this, I repeated the entire modelling process at <strong>0.02 s</strong> and
    <strong>0.05 s</strong>. Every burst was therefore fitted three times with three different levels of smoothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal was simple: if a pause was genuinely present in the data, it should appear in all three
    time-binnings — not just one.
  </p>

  <p>
    Comparing the fits across all three resolutions acted as an additional robustness test, helping highlight
    cases where the “pause” might simply be the result of noise, under-binning, or over-smoothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach made the final significance testing far more reliable, and prevented the analysis from being
    driven by choices that could unintentionally support the outcome I was expecting.
  </p>
</section>

<div class="wavy-divider"></div>

<!-- SECTION 6 – SIGNIFICANCE TESTING -->
<section id="mp-significance">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">6 – Significance Testing</h4>

  <p>
    Once bursts had been modelled and a pause had been detected, the light curves were assessed for
    statistically significant pauses.
  </p>

  <p>
    Statistical significance was tested in two ways:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Pause length significance</li>
    <li>Pause gradient significance</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To assess pause length significance, the measured pause length was divided by its associated error,
    giving a significance in units of standard deviations (σ). A minimum threshold of <strong>3σ</strong>
    was required for a pause to be considered significant.
  </p>

  <p>
    To assess pause gradient significance, the gradient value was divided by its associated error, again
    giving the significance in standard deviations (σ). A gradient was considered significant if it
    exceeded the <strong>3σ</strong> threshold.
  </p>

  <p>
    Across <strong>112 significance tests</strong> (different bursts, models, time-binnings, pause lengths,
    and gradients), <strong>31 tests</strong> were found to be significant — corresponding to
    <strong>10 individual model fits</strong> across <strong>7 bursts</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Only one burst had consistent significance across both pause length and pause gradient:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Source:</strong> 4U_0513-40 &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>OBSID:</strong> 1050010111</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Two other bursts had consistent pause-length significance only:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Source:</strong> 4U_1636-536 &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>OBSID:</strong> 1050080112</li>
    <li><strong>Source:</strong> 4U_1728-34 &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>OBSID:</strong> 1050150127</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It is important to note that pause gradient significance is not as important as pause length
    significance. The primary question is whether a pause is present at all, rather than the exact shape
    it takes.
  </p>
</section>

<div class="wavy-divider"></div>

<!-- SECTION 7 – KEY FINDINGS -->
<section id="mp-findings">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">7 – Key Findings</h4>

  <p>
    The results can be summarised as follows:
  </p>

  <p>
    Three bursts exhibited statistically significant pauses across all corresponding tests. The sources
    and measured durations were:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>4U_0513-40</strong> — pause of <strong>10.07 s ± 0.38</strong></li>
    <li><strong>4U_1636-536</strong> — pause of <strong>0.47 s ± 0.053</strong></li>
    <li><strong>4U_1728-34</strong> — pause of <strong>0.53 s ± 0.014</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Of these, the pause detected in <strong>4U_0513-40</strong> was the most robust, with concerns
    regarding model dependence affecting the other two detections.
  </p>

  <p>
    In short, the project found a very convincing example of the pause feature in <strong>4U_0513-40</strong>,
    showing significance across all models and all time-binnings tested.
  </p>

  <p>
    Examples of the final light curves showing clear pauses can be found in Section 4 – Modelling.
  </p>
</section>

<div class="wavy-divider"></div>

<!-- SECTION 8 – DISSERTATION WRITING -->
<section id="mp-writing">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">8 – Dissertation Writing</h4>

  <p>
    The final aspect of the project was producing a full write-up — the dissertation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The dissertation contained:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Abstract</li>
    <li>Introduction</li>
    <li>Theoretical Background</li>
    <li>Methods</li>
    <li>Discussion</li>
    <li>Conclusion</li>
    <li>Appendix</li>
    <li>References</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Theoretical Background section was based heavily on the earlier bullet-point notes produced
    during the Research Phase.
  </p>

  <p>
    As mentioned elsewhere on this site, the report was typeset in <span class="latex-logo">

<!-- SECTION 9 – ANALYTICAL SKILLS DEMONSTRATED -->
<section id="mp-skills">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">9 – Analytical Skills Demonstrated</h4>
  <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The following skills and explanations were generated by AI (ChatGPT) - I was unsure what skills were relevent in a finance setting, so I fed the AI my Dissertation, the Summery Report, and the Infomation on this page. The following is what it determined were the best analytical skills displayed throughout the project.</p>

  <ul class="mp-skills-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Independent research & critical evaluation</strong> — filtering large numbers of papers,
      identifying relevant modelling approaches, spotting inconsistencies, and deciding which methods were
      reliable enough to build on. This mirrors how analysts evaluate conflicting market views or research
      signals before committing to an idea.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Building a reproducible data pipeline</strong> — constructing a workflow that consistently
      transformed raw data into clean, analysable segments, with standardised filters and export steps.
      This reflects the need for structured, auditable processes when working with financial datasets.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Noise reduction & bias control</strong> — recognising the risk of subjectivity in choosing
      time bins, standardising the binning to 0.01 s, and then repeating the full analysis at 0.02 s and
      0.05 s. Comparing all outcomes helped avoid “nice-looking but false” signals, directly paralleling
      robustness testing in quantitative finance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Model comparison & statistical validation</strong> — comparing multiple model variants,
      evaluating chi-squared values, assessing parameter stability, and running 112 significance tests.
      This reinforced the habit of relying on statistical evidence rather than intuition.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Interpreting complex systems</strong> — focusing not just on getting models to fit, but on
      understanding why certain bursts showed strong evidence while others did not. This required breaking
      down a complex system and deciding which results were genuinely meaningful.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Structured communication</strong> — producing both a detailed dissertation and a clear
      summary, explaining complex concepts logically and accessibly. This is directly relevant to
      presenting analysis, writing research notes, and communicating model behaviour in a finance context.

  <h4 class="mp-subheading">Engineering</h4>

  <p>
    During my final year of university, I undertook a project unlike anything I had attempted before.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The Aim:</strong> To open my curtain from bed.
    <br><br>
    <strong>The Reasoning:</strong> When first waking up in the morning, I had a bad habit of falling straight
    back to sleep. The basic idea was that when I initially woke up, I could press a button, the curtain would
    open, and the sunlight would naturally keep me awake.
  </p>

  <p>
    (There was also the incentive of potentially expanding the project into a viable business idea.)
    <br><br>
  </p>

  <h4>Initial Concept</h4>
  <p>
    I first worked on how to get the curtain to move. I sketched multiple concepts and settled on a simple
    “reel-in” mechanism as the most reliable way of pulling the curtain open.
  </p>

  <p>
    The idea was straightforward: use a spinning motor shaft to reel in a length of string attached to the
    curtain, with the motor mounted at the end of the curtain pole.
  </p>

  <h4>Remote Activation</h4>
  <p>
    Next, I needed to activate the motor remotely. The simplest solution was to use a pre-built remote control
    system. I chose a garage-door opener relay module.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the idea clear in my head, I purchased everything I needed for £35.47:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>1 × Remote Control Relay</li>
    <li>1 × 10 pcs Micro DC Motors Kit</li>
    <li>1 × Electronics Kit</li>
    <li>1 × Double AA battery holder</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="software-images">
    <img src="inital-buy.jpg" alt="Initial electronics purchase for the curtain opener project">
  </div>

  <h4>Prototype 1</h4>
  <p>
    The next stages involved a lot of trial and error — and improvisation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The two AA batteries were not powerful enough to activate the remote relay. It required over 12V to
    function, so I wired in two 9V batteries instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    I created a makeshift reel using a broken Bic pen, some cardboard, string, and a hook from a clothes
    hanger.
  </p>

  <p>
    The whole setup was mounted onto the corner of an old chopping board. (I needed a strong base that I could
    shape — the spare plastic board was easier to cut than wood!)
  </p>

  <div class="software-images">
    <img src="prototype-1.jpg" alt="First prototype of the curtain opener mechanism">
  </div>

  <p>
    Prototype 1 had one major flaw: the motor simply wasn't powerful enough. It was designed for model
    aeroplanes, prioritising high RPM rather than torque.
  </p>

  <h4>Final Version</h4>
  <p>
    Not wanting to give up, I purchased a more powerful motor:
  </p>

  <div class="software-images">
    <img src="power.jpg" alt="More powerful motor used in the final curtain opener">
  </div>

  <p>
    In heindsight the motor was overpowered for what I required, but at the time I didn't want to waste money with another underpowered motor. 
  </p>
  <p>
    With the new motor installed and rewired (this time requiring proper soldering), the curtain opener finally
    worked.
  </p>

  <!-- CURRENT RESTORATION PROJECT -->
  <h4>Current Restoration Project</h4>
  <p>
    I am currently restoring three pine boxes; they have been used and abused for many years by my younger
    self. Even writing my name on them to avoid my sister claiming ownership.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am in the process of sanding them down, starting with 60-grit sandpaper and gradually working up to
    180-grit for a smooth finish. The final stage will involve applying a wax finish.
  </p>

  <p><em>Below are two of the pine boxes — the left in its original condition, the right sanded at 60-grit on flat surfaces.</em></p>

  <!-- RECLAIMED WOOD PROJECT -->
  <h4>Reclaimed Wood Project</h4>
  <p>
    Using a reclaimed scaffolding board, I built both a shoe rack and a hanging clothes rail. The supports
    for the shoe rack were also reused from an older project, while the threaded metal bars for the hanging
    storage had to be purchased.
  </p>

    This bedside table was custom-built to fit a specific space next to my bed in a previous house. It
    includes book storage at the front, open storage underneath, and a hidden compartment accessible beneath
    the hinged lid.

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <div class="software-text">
    <p>
      Used for data analysis; model fitting, model creation, visualisation, statistical analysis,
      extracting key parameters from data, object-oriented programming, scripting, and handling large,
      messy datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Python was the first programming language I learnt, and my first experience was through an academic
      module: Physics Skills: Programming and Data Analysis (74).
    </p>

    <p>
      Since then, I have used it extensively in labs modules, personal projects, and critically, in my
      master’s project.
    </p>

    <p>
      For my master’s project I plotted data extracted from NASA’s NICER mission, applied model fitting,
      created a new model variant, extracted key parameters, and exported to Excel for interpretation of
      results.
    </p>

    <p><em>
      Below are examples of the code used for fitting a power-law model to the burst data (second image shows fitting section). The last image 
      is the resulting plot of the burst data with the model fitted on top.
    </p></em>

    <p><em>
      The start of the script was written in such a way that when wanting to fit multiple bursts, 
      everything that needed changing between bursts was easily accessible at the top. (First image)

      </p>

      <p>
        From the equations govening the pink line we can determin how fast the burst started, where it paused, and how long it paused for. Additionaly, I then calculated how good the fit was by calculating the chi squared value, an indicator of how accuratly the model represents the data.

<div id="software-matlab" class="software-block-vertical">


  <h3>MATLAB</h3>

  <div class="software-text">
    <p>
      MATLAB was the programming language of choice for my summer placement at the University of
      Southampton. Having no prior experience with it, I learnt the basics first, then developed strong
      understanding over the 8 weeks I was working.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was used for two main purposes:
    </p>
    <p>
      1 – controlling an attocube nano-positioner for experimental positioning of a sample<br>
      2 – producing plots and performing light modelling on resulting data – mostly as a method of debugging issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      The syntax felt very similar to Python, so I picked it up quickly, and by the end of the placement I
      was confident using MATLAB for automated control, data handling, and visualisation.
    </p>

    <p><em>
      Below is an example script that I produced during the placement; this script handled moving the
      positioner to a predetermined location, acting as a starting point or a recall after movement.
    </p></em>

      The next image is an extract from the logbook I kept during the placement. It shows two plots:
    </p>
    <p>
      Top – ‘Power vs Ticks’ this is the transmitted power through the optical setup against movement ticks
      (Due to how small the movement is, a true step size cannot be certain. A small voltage is applied that
      moves the positioner 1.7&nbsp;µm on average, each jolt of movement is called a ‘tick’)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bottom – ‘Transmissions ratio vs X’ this is a plot used to work out the maximum transmitted power we
      could expect based on the optical set-up’s current state.

  <h3>Linux</h3>

  <div class="software-text">
    <p>
      During my master’s project, the acquisition, manipulation, and cutting of data was performed within
      a Linux environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data was obtained from NASA’s HEASARC Browser then processed using HEASoft, a unified package for
      X-ray data analysis. Within the HEASoft environment several key commands were run:
    </p>

    <pre class="linux-terminal">nicerL2 indir=OBSID clobber=YES</pre>
    <p>
      Runs NICER level-2 calibration that includes standard calibration, screening, and filtering of data.
    </p>

    <pre class="linux-terminal">xselect</pre>
    <p>
      Launches Xselect to allow reading in of events and application of key Ftools listed below.
    </p>

    <pre class="linux-terminal">set binsize 0.01</pre>
    <p>
      Sets the time bin size on the light curve, here 0.01 s. Smaller bin sizes yield more accurate
      representations of observed counts but introduce larger errors due to fewer counts per bin.
    </p>

    <pre class="linux-terminal">filter pha cut 30 1000</pre>
    <p>
      Applies an energy filter with lower (30) and upper (1000) cutoff, here corresponding to 0.3–10 keV
      (note: pha = pulse height amplitude). This filter removes photons outside of this energy range, which
      is standard practice for NICER observations of compact objects as it ensures relevant data and reduces
      background noise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the raw data had been processed, the data was plotted to locate the area I was interested in
      (the burst). The data itself was an almost continuous acquisition from instruments onboard the
      International Space Station; the bursts had to be located manually.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once located, I cut down the data to just include the burst and prepared it for export to Python for
      modelling and analysis.
    </p>

    <p><em>
      Below is an example of what the data looks like after processing. The vertical line marks the burst.
      The Y-axis shows Rate as counts/s (think of this as energy being detected from the star). The X-axis
      is time in seconds – here we see ~20 hours of exposure.

      I do not consider myself an advanced user, but I am confident working with data in Excel, creating
      clean tables and charts, and using Excel alongside Python when organising and presenting results.

  <h3>HTML</h3>

  <div class="software-text">
    <p>
      This website uses HTML to control what appears on the screen, defining the main structure, layout,
      and sections.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before starting this project, I had never worked in HTML. As of completion of this website, the
      script sits at 955 lines.

  <h3>CSS</h3>

  <div class="software-text">
    <p>
      The CSS script controls visual appearance and layout, covering fonts, spacing, the folder “tabs”
      look, and the responsive layout.
    </p>

    <p>
      Again, I had never worked in CSS before this website. The script currently sits at 894 lines.

  <div class="software-text">

      Used here to add interactive tab functionality, JavaScript marks the third new language that
      has been used to build this site.
