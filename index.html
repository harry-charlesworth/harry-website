  <h3>Site Overview</h3>
  <p>
    This site was originally created to present who I am beyond the limits of a CV.
    It now also serves another purpose: demonstrates my ability to learn new skills
    rapidly and apply them effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    With no prior experience in web development, I built this website from scratch
    using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I believe this website serves as a demonstration
    of my work ethic, adaptability, and determination to pursue a career in finance.

    <!-- ===============================
         RESEARCH ASSISTANT EXPERIENCE
         =============================== -->

    <h3 style="color:#e60000;">Research Assistant – University of Southampton (Detailed Summary)</h3>

    <p>
      I was invited to undertake an eight-week funded research studentship after achieving 90% in my third-year final lab project. The project involved working with a hollow-fibre experimental set-up designed to operate under vacuum and cryogenic conditions - a complex setup that required careful optimisation and precision control.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the eight weeks, I gained a full understanding of the system, optimised light transmission through the fibre and set-up, and developed MATLAB control software for a nano-positioner used to house a sample. This included writing routines for positioning, calibration, and automated recall, as well as troubleshooting the hardware–software interface. Alongside this, I carried out signal checks, data collection and analysis, and solved unique problems requiring innovative thinking. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The placement strengthened several key skills:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Hands-on problem solving with complex physical systems</li>
      <li>MATLAB programming, automation, and hardware control</li>
      <li>Data-driven reasoning and iterative optimisation</li>
      <li>Working with vacuum and cryogenic equipment</li>
      <li>Communicating technical progress clearly to senior academics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I successfully delivered the optimised setup and the full control code by the project deadline. Based on my performance, the senior academic I was working under expressed interest in creating a PhD opportunity for me.

      During this project, I processed and manipulated large datasets in Linux, exported key segments to Python, developed a new model variant from existing approaches, fitted the data with multiple models to extract parameters, and validated the results through statistical significance testing. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This required building a systematic filtering pipeline, handling noisy real-world data, comparing competing models, and assessing the robustness of any detected features. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The work strengthened my coding ability, statistical reasoning, data-cleaning workflow, and confidence working independently on a complex analytical problem from start to finish.

      The workflow mirrors the process of evaluating trading signals: large-scale data handling, noise reduction, model comparison, parameter extraction, robustness testing, and avoiding false positives.

    <p>
      It taught me to be sceptical of “nice-looking” features, to validate results quantitatively, and to build analysis pipelines that can be repeated, adapted, and stress tested. The same mindset required for research, portfolio analysis, and quantitative decision-making in finance.

<h3>Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing</h3>

<p>
  Breaking into quantitative finance is my long-term goal. Roles such as quantitative analyst, quantitative researcher, or hedge fund
  analyst are where I ultimately want to build my career. I'm very aware that these paths are competitive and often require a strong
  technical foundation, proven numerical ability, and willingness to start wherever is necessary and grow into more advanced roles 
  over time.
</p>
<p>
  I chose to build a project because talking about skills is never as convincing as demonstrating them. Monte Carlo option pricing 
  is a perfect fit, fundamental to quantitative finance, mathematically rich, and technically demanding. Working through this 
  project should allow me to demonstrate the core abilities I already hold and develop some of the skills required for quantitative roles.

<!-- SECTION 1 – OVERVIEW -->
<section id="fp-overview">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">1 – Project Overview</h4>

  <p>
    The project has been split into four distinct phases, with an additional final phase focused on peer review and professional feedback:
  </p>
  <h5 class="phase-title">Phase 1 – Research Phase</h5>
  <p>
    Part 1: Gain a basic understanding of Monte Carlo simulations in general, and how they are applied to pricing options
  </p>
  <p>
    Part 2: Review existing literature (academic papers) to build a solid mathematical and numerical 
    foundation. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This phase ensures every later decision on models, methods, and implementation choices are grounded in establised theory.
  </p>

  <h5 class="phase-title">Phase 2 – Determining Project Direction</h5>
  <p>
    Using the insights from the research phase, this stage defines the project's scope, structure, and technical priorities.
    In other words, this phase turns the research into a concrete project roadmap. The six Monte Carlo
    papers I’m reviewing will directly inform what gets implemented, in what order, and to what level
    of depth.
  </p>

  <h5 class="phase-title">Phase 3 – Implementation</h5>
  <p>
    This phase is where the ideas become code, generating results and findings that I can discuss.
    This phase will deliver the bulk of the project and will have various sub-stages, to be determined in Phase 2.
  </p>

  <h5 class="phase-title">Phase 4 – LaTeX Report</h5>
  <p>
    A polished write-up of the project will be completed. Presenting the models, numerical methods, results, and reasoning 
    in a clear, professional, and reproducible format.
  </p>

  <h5 class="phase-title">Phase 5 – Peer Review</h5>
  <p>
    The final stage, where the completed project and report are reviewed by industry professionals and peers. Their feedback will help 
    refine the work and validate its quality.
  </p>

<!-- SECTION 2 – RESEARCH PHASE -->
<section id="fp-phase1">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">2 – Research Phase (Phase 1)</h4>

  <p>
    I had come across the concept of Monte Carlo simulations during my degree, but my understanding was patchy and in reference to Physics 
    rather than Finance. I started this project by researching Monte Carlo simulations, learning the fundamentals first, then moving on
    to how they are applied in a financial setting, and finally conducting a literature Review in reference to pricing options.
  </p>

  <p>
    During Part 1 of this Research Phase, I came across new terminology and concepts that I would need to understand before moving on - 
    this led to the creation of the Finance Glossary (found at the top of this page) that helped me understand terms and what they 
    actually mean.
  </p>
<br><br>
  <h5 class="phase-title">Part 1: Basic Understanding</h5>
  <p>
    This part consisted of watching and making notes on two YouTube videos. The summary can be found underneath this text,
    and the raw notes can be found next to each link. This step gave me a solid foundation of understanding before moving on
    to academic papers.

<br><br>
  <h5 class="phase-title">Part 2: Literature Review</h5>

  <p>
    Now armed with a solid foundation, I collected 6 research papers. The aim of this part was to understand the theory and orient 
    myself technically and mathematically. It also aims to provide the building blocks for the project as a whole and help with refining
    the scope.

<h3>Finance Glossary Project</h3>

<p>
When I started the Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing project, I came across new terminology that I would need to understand before I could start the project phases (i.e. Early Exercise, Greeks, Non-linear Risk).
</p>

<p>
Understanding the terminology used in finance wasn’t new; I had already researched certain areas for experiences (i.e. Invesco), interviews (i.e. Ebury), and a general interest in finance. For those examples, I created revision cards for terminology and looked terms up until I was satisfied I understood the word or phrase.
</p>

<p>
Having kept the revision cards and now having a new list of words to investigate, I decided to build a glossary of all the finance terms I had come across. Initially intended to be fully alphabetical with no categories, the first version was a mess. It was just a bank of words that didn’t help with understanding concepts in finance.
</p>

<p>
The glossary needed organising - this was done through the use of categories. Details on the categories chosen is below, but for example, all assets are organised under the Asset tag and grouped together in the glossary.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
This project has taught me a lot about finance terminology, how some terms can have multiple meanings (i.e. Alpha as a performance indicator vs Alpha as the drift term), the classification of concepts, and what belongs in each category. It has also forced me to check my understanding of ideas I thought I already understood.
</p>

<p>
  <em>The glossary will be continuously updated as I conduct research and learn.
It currently sits at 246 terms with 20 categories - link to the glossary below.</em>

<div class="wavy-divider"></div>


 <h3>Glossary Categories</h3>

 <p>Fitting terms into groups helped me understand not just what each word means, but how the pieces fit together. These categories helped turn a list of definitions into a clearer picture of how finance, markets, and quant methods interact.</p>

 <p>Below are the categories used in the glossary, with the first three terms shown beneath each title</p>

<h3>This Website</h3>

<p>
  I initially wanted to create a website to provide a deeper explanation of who I am and what I have
  done. A CV can only show so much, and many aspects of my experience, skills, and personality simply
  cannot be conveyed on a single sheet of paper.
</p>

<p>
  This website now also stands as a testament to my drive, determination, and adaptability. Once I
  decided to build it, I explored three different approaches:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Online website builders</strong> such as Wix which allow you to assemble pages using
      standard visual tools.</li>
  <li><strong>AI-driven platforms</strong>, where a chatbot edits or generates the code behind the
      scenes.</li>
  <li><strong>Building a website entirely from scratch</strong>, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  To have full control over the structure, behaviour, and appearance of the site - and to challenge
  myself - I chose to build it from scratch.
</p>

<p>
  Starting from completely blank pages in TextEdit, I wrote the initial scripts needed to host a local
  test page. From there, every single line, colour, indent, layout choice, tab, and interactive element
  has been written by hand.
</p>

<div class="wavy-divider"></div>
<h4 class="project-subheading">Behind The Curtain </h4>
<p>
  This website runs on three programming languages, which, before this project, I had never worked with.
  I now have a much deeper understanding of all three.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>HTML</strong> controls what appears on the screen, defining the main structure, layout, and content
  of each page.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>CSS</strong> controls the visual appearance, styling, and layout, including fonts, spacing,
  colours, the folder-style tabs, and responsive behaviour across different screen sizes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>JavaScript</strong> adds interactivity, such as the dynamic tab system and the clickable project
  boxes at the top of this section.
</p>


<p>
  For code snippets taken directly from the scripts behind this site, visit the
  <strong>Software</strong> tab and click on <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, or
  <strong>JavaScript</strong>.
</p>

<p><strong>Current script sizes:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML – 2497 lines</li>
  <li>CSS – 1350 lines</li>
  <li>JavaScript – 59 lines</li>

<!-- SECTION 1 – OVERVIEW -->
<section id="mp-overview">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">1 – Project Overview (Analytical Perspective)</h4>

  <p>
    From a data/analysis perspective, I wanted to take noisy astrophysical data, clean it, find key features,
    cut down the large dataset, fit with multiple models, compare model results, validate results
    statistically, interpret findings, and present results.
  </p>

  <p>
    In practical terms, a very interesting feature in the light curves (plotted intensity of an object against 
    time) had been observed twice in recent years, an apparent pause in counts during the rise phase of a burst. I was searching a very large database to find as many 
    examples of this feature as possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    To understand the pause feature, astronomers need much more information than two examples can provide. Questions 
    such as: How often does it appear? What conditions are necessary for the feature to be produced? Does it 
    appear every time? Is the feature real? What physics is at play to make the feature appear?  
    can only be answered when there are more examples to study.
  </p>

  <p>
    My project revolved around finding as many examples of this pause feature as possible, so future work could 
    potentially answer the questions above.
  </p>
</section>

<div class="wavy-divider"></div>

<!-- SECTION 2 – RESEARCH PHASE -->
<section id="mp-research">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">2 – Research Phase & Strategy</h4>

  <p>
    To begin the project, I conducted thorough research of academic papers and online material, searching for a 
    few key details:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Previous findings of the pause feature</li>
    <li>The physics at play</li>
    <li>Modelling methods</li>
    <li>Common approaches to presenting burst data</li>
    <li>Gaps and inconsistencies across papers</li>
    <li>Latest findings and studies</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I collected a significant number of papers, skimmed through to assess relevance to the areas above, flagged 
    papers by importance, printed key studies for closer assessment, and finally made bullet-point style notes.
  </p>

  <p>
    This phase was essential to the success of the project, as it allowed a deeper understanding and previous work
    to guide the rest of the project.
  </p>
</section>

<div class="wavy-divider"></div>

<!-- SECTION 3 – DATA PIPELINE -->
<section id="mp-pipeline">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">3 – Data Pipeline Phase</h4>

  <p>
    Once 248 bursts (the pause feature happens during a burst) from 50 sources (i.e. stars) had been identified, I 
    employed the following systematic approach for handling data:
  </p>

  <img src="data-pipeline.jpg" class="software-images" alt="Data pipeline diagram">

  <p>
    Filter 1 represented removing bursts that could not be identified; Filter 2 was a quality assessment.  
    The quality assessment removed bursts for various reasons, such as excessive noise, severe background 
    contamination, energy filtering suppressing the burst rise phase, or absence of a distinct burst signature.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the initial screening, I searched the remaining 65 bursts for any sign that the feature might be 
    present, and ended with 26 candidate bursts.
  </p>
</section>

<div class="wavy-divider"></div>

<!-- SECTION 4 – MODELLING -->
<section id="mp-modelling">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">4 – Modelling</h4>

  <p>
    The bursts were modelled using piecewise fitting. This effectively gets a computer program to trial 
    different lines and curves over the data and select the most accurate combination.
  </p>

  <p>
    In practice, the combinations of lines and curves have to be specified. The program is given an equation for each segment 
    (e.g. a straight line <em>y = m·x + c</em> or a power law <em>y = A·x<sup>k</sup></em>), and tries different 
    combinations of the variables <em>y, m, x, c, A, k</em>, constantly comparing which combination gave the 
    closest fit.
  </p>

  <p>
    The best fit was determined by calculating a chi-squared value, which measures how accurately a given line 
    represents the data it is covering.
  </p>

  <p>
    Four segments were defined in Python:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>1st Segment:</strong> models the background level of counts</li>
    <li><strong>2nd Segment:</strong> models the initial rise in counts</li>
    <li><strong>3rd Segment:</strong> models the feature I wanted to study</li>
    <li><strong>4th Segment:</strong> models the continued rise in counts after the feature</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Three different model variants were used, following the structure below:
  </p>

<!-- 5 – TIME-BINNING -->
<section id="mp-timebinning">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">5 – Time-Binning & Mitigating Bias</h4>

  <p>
    Time-binning became one of the most important parts of the project, mainly because of how easily it
    could introduce subjectivity into the results. When plotting burst data, the choice of time bin directly
    affects the appearance of the light curve, how smooth or noisy it looks, and—critically—whether a pause
    is visible at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    To reduce the risk of “choosing” bins that supported the presence of a pause, I standardised the entire
    analysis to a bin size of <strong>0.01 s</strong>. This gave high time resolution and ensured all initial fits
    were performed consistently.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, using only one bin size still carried the risk that the results were influenced by the chosen
    resolution. To address this, I repeated the entire modelling process at <strong>0.02 s</strong> and
    <strong>0.05 s</strong>. Every burst was therefore fitted three times with three different levels of smoothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal was simple: if a pause was genuinely present in the data, it should appear in all three
    time-binnings — not just one.
  </p>

  <p>
    Comparing the fits across all three resolutions acted as an additional robustness test, helping highlight
    cases where the “pause” might simply be the result of noise, under-binning, or over-smoothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    This approach made the final significance testing far more reliable and prevented the analysis from being
    driven by choices that could unintentionally support the outcome I was expecting.

<!-- SECTION 6 – SIGNIFICANCE TESTING -->
<section id="mp-significance">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">6 – Statistical Significance Testing</h4>

  <p>
    Once bursts had been modelled and a pause had been detected, the light curves were assessed for
    statistically significant pauses.
  </p>

  <p>
    Statistical significance was tested in two ways:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Pause length significance</li>
    <li>Pause gradient significance</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To assess pause length significance, the measured pause length was divided by its associated error,
    giving a significance in units of standard deviations (σ). A minimum threshold of <strong>3σ</strong>
    was required for a pause to be considered significant.
  </p>

  <p>
    To assess pause gradient significance, the gradient value was divided by its associated error, again
    giving the significance in standard deviations (σ). A gradient was considered significant if it
    exceeded the <strong>3σ</strong> threshold.
  </p>

  <p>
    Across <strong>112 significance tests</strong> (different bursts, models, time-binnings, pause lengths,
    and gradients), <strong>31 tests</strong> were found to be significant — corresponding to
    <strong>10 individual model fits</strong> across <strong>7 bursts</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Only one burst had consistent significance across both pause length and pause gradient:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Source:</strong> 4U_0513-40 &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>OBSID:</strong> 1050010111</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Two other bursts had consistent pause-length significance only:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Source:</strong> 4U_1636-536 &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>OBSID:</strong> 1050080112</li>
    <li><strong>Source:</strong> 4U_1728-34 &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>OBSID:</strong> 1050150127</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It is important to note that pause gradient significance is not as important as pause length
    significance. The primary question is whether a pause is present at all, rather than the exact shape
    it takes.

<!-- SECTION 7 – KEY FINDINGS -->
<section id="mp-findings">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">7 – Key Findings</h4>

  <p>
    The results can be summarised as follows:
  </p>

  <p>
    Three bursts exhibited statistically significant pauses across all corresponding tests. The sources
    and measured durations were:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>4U_0513-40</strong> — pause of <strong>10.07 s ± 0.38</strong></li>
    <li><strong>4U_1636-536</strong> — pause of <strong>0.47 s ± 0.053</strong></li>
    <li><strong>4U_1728-34</strong> — pause of <strong>0.53 s ± 0.014</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Of these, the pause detected in <strong>4U_0513-40</strong> was the most robust, with concerns
    regarding model dependence affecting the other two detections.
  </p>

  <p>
    In short, the project found a very convincing example of the pause feature in <strong>4U_0513-40</strong>,
    showing significance across all models and all time-binnings tested.
  </p>

  <p>
    Examples of the final light curves showing clear pauses can be found in Section 4 – Modelling.

<!-- SECTION 8 – DISSERTATION WRITING -->
<section id="mp-writing">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">8 – Dissertation Writing</h4>

  <p>
    The final aspect of the project was producing a full write-up — the dissertation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The dissertation contained:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Abstract</li>
    <li>Introduction</li>
    <li>Theoretical Background</li>
    <li>Methods</li>
    <li>Discussion</li>
    <li>Conclusion</li>

    <li>References</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Theoretical Background section was based heavily on the earlier bullet-point notes produced
    during the Research Phase.
  </p>

  <p>
    As mentioned elsewhere on this site, the report was typeset in <span class="latex-logo">

<!-- SECTION 9 – ANALYTICAL SKILLS DEMONSTRATED -->
<section id="mp-skills">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">9 – Analytical Skills Demonstrated</h4>
  <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The following skills and explanations were generated by AI (ChatGPT) - I was unsure what skills were relevent in a finance setting, so I fed the AI my Dissertation, the Summery Report, and the Infomation on this page. The following is what it determined to be the best analytical skills displayed throughout the project.</p>

  <ul class="mp-skills-list">
    <li>
      <strong>Independent research & critical evaluation</strong> — filtering large numbers of papers,
      identifying relevant modelling approaches, spotting inconsistencies, and deciding which methods were
      reliable enough to build on. This mirrors how analysts evaluate conflicting market views or research
      signals before committing to an idea.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Building a reproducible data pipeline</strong> — constructing a workflow that consistently
      transforms raw data into clean, analysable segments, with standardised filters and export steps.
      This reflects the need for structured, auditable processes when working with financial datasets.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Noise reduction & bias control</strong> — recognising the risk of subjectivity in choosing
      time bins, standardising the binning to 0.01 s, and then repeating the full analysis at 0.02 s and
      0.05 s. Comparing all outcomes helped avoid “nice-looking but false” signals, directly paralleling
      robustness testing in quantitative finance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Model comparison & statistical validation</strong> — comparing multiple model variants,
      evaluating chi-squared values, assessing parameter stability, and running 112 significance tests.
      This reinforced the habit of relying on statistical evidence rather than intuition.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Interpreting complex systems</strong> — focusing not just on getting models to fit, but on
      understanding why certain bursts showed strong evidence while others did not. This required breaking
      down a complex system and deciding which results were genuinely meaningful.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Structured communication</strong> — producing both a detailed dissertation and a clear
      summary, explaining complex concepts logically and accessibly. This is directly relevant to
      presenting analysis, writing research notes, and communicating model behaviour in a finance context.

<section id="engineering-project">
  <h4 class="mp-subheading">Engineering</h4>

  <p>
    During my final year of university, I undertook a project unlike anything I had attempted before.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The Aim:</strong> To open my curtain from bed.
    <br><br>
    <strong>The Reasoning:</strong> I’ve always found that I don’t fully wake up until I see natural light, so I wanted an automated way to bring sunlight into the room the moment I woke up.
  </p>

  <p>
    (There was also the incentive of potentially expanding the project into a viable business idea.)
    <br><br>
  </p>

  <h4>Initial Concept</h4>
  <p>
    I first worked on how to get the curtain to move. I sketched multiple concepts and settled on a simple
    “reel-in” mechanism as the most reliable way of pulling the curtain open.
  </p>

  <p>
    The idea was straightforward: use a spinning motor shaft to reel in a length of string attached to the
    curtain, with the motor mounted at the end of the curtain pole.
  </p>

  <h4>Remote Activation</h4>
  <p>
    Next, I needed to activate the motor remotely. The simplest solution was to use a pre-built remote control
    system. I chose a garage-door opener relay module.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the idea clear in my head, I purchased everything I needed for £35.47:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>1 × Remote Control Relay</li>
    <li>1 × 10 pcs Micro DC Motors Kit</li>
    <li>1 × Electronics Kit</li>
    <li>1 × Double AA battery holder</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="software-images">
    <img src="inital-buy.jpg" alt="Initial electronics purchase for the curtain opener project">
  </div>

  <h4>Prototype 1</h4>
  <p>
    The next stages involved a lot of trial and error — and improvisation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The two AA batteries were not powerful enough to activate the remote relay. It required over 12V to
    function, so I wired in two 9V batteries instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    I created a makeshift reel using a broken Bic pen, some cardboard, string, and a hook from a clothes
    hanger.
  </p>

  <p>
    The whole setup was mounted onto the corner of an old chopping board. (I needed a strong base that I could
    shape — the spare plastic board was easier to cut than wood!)
  </p>

  <div class="software-images">
    <img src="prototype-1.jpg" alt="First prototype of the curtain opener mechanism">
  </div>

  <p>
    Prototype 1 had one major flaw: the motor simply wasn't powerful enough. It was designed for model
    aeroplanes, prioritising high RPM rather than torque.
  </p>

  <h4>Final Version</h4>
  <p>
    Not wanting to give up, I purchased a more powerful motor:
  </p>

  <div class="software-images">
    <img src="power.jpg" alt="More powerful motor used in the final curtain opener">
  </div>

  <p>
    In heindsight the motor was overpowered for what I required, but at the time I didn't want to waste money with another underpowered motor. 
  </p>
  <p>
    With the new motor installed and rewired (this time requiring proper soldering), the curtain opener finally
    worked.
  </p>

  <h4>Current Restoration Project</h4>
  <p>
    I am currently restoring three pine boxes; they have been used and abused for many years by my younger
    self. Even wrote my name on them to avoid my sister claiming ownership.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am in the process of sanding them down, starting with 60-grit sandpaper and gradually working up to
    180-grit for a smooth finish. The final stage will involve applying a wax finish.
  </p>

  <p><em>Below are two of the pine boxes — the left in its original condition, the right sanded at 60-grit on flat surfaces.</em></p>

  <!-- RECLAIMED WOOD PROJECT -->
  <h4>Reclaimed Wood Project</h4>
  <p>
    Using a reclaimed scaffolding board, I built both a shoe rack and a hanging clothes rail. The supports
    for the shoe rack were also reused from an older project, while the threaded metal bars for the hanging
    storage had to be purchased.

<div id="software-python" class="software-block-vertical">


  <h3>Python (Programming Language)</h3>

  <div class="software-text">
    <p>
      Used for data analysis, model fitting, model creation, visualisation, statistical analysis,
      extracting key parameters from data, object-oriented programming, scripting, and handling large,
      messy datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Python was the first programming language I learnt, and my first experience was through an academic
      module: Physics Skills: Programming and Data Analysis (74).
    </p>

    <p>
      Since then, I have used it extensively in lab modules, personal projects, and critically, in my
      master’s project.
    </p>

    <p>
      For my master’s project, I used Python to plot data extracted from NASA’s NICER mission, apply model fitting,
      created a new model variant, extracted key parameters, and then prepared data for export to Excel for interpretation of
      results.
    </p>

    <p><em>
      Below are examples of the code used for fitting a power-law model to the burst data (the second image shows the fitting section). The last image 
      is the resulting plot of the burst data with the model fitted on top.
    </p></em>

    <p><em>
      The start of the script was written in such a way that when wanting to fit multiple bursts, 
      everything that needed changing between bursts was easily accessible at the top. (First image)
    </p></em>
  </div>


  <div class="software-images">

      Above: Fitted Light Curve for 4U 0513-40. Showing a clear pause in the second fitted segment. Here, the Green dots are the number of X-rays detected every 0.05 seconds, and the pink line is the fitted model.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the equations governing the pink line, we can determine how fast the burst started, where it paused, and how long it paused for. Additionally, I then calculated how good the fit was by calculating the chi-squared value, an indicator of how accurately the model represents the data.
      </p>

  <h3>MATLAB (Programming Language)</h3>

  <div class="software-text">
    <p>
      MATLAB was the programming language of choice for my summer placement at the University of
      Southampton. Having no prior experience with it, I learnt the basics first, then developed a strong
      understanding over the 8 weeks I was working.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was used for two main purposes:
    </p>
    <p>
      1 – Controlling an attocube nano-positioner for experimental positioning of a sample<br>
      2 – Producing plots and performing light modelling on resulting data – mostly as a method of debugging issues.
    </p>

    <p>
      The syntax felt very similar to Python, so I picked it up quickly, by the end of the placement. I
      was confident using MATLAB for automated control, data handling, and visualisation.
    </p>

    <p><em>
      Below is an example script that I produced during the placement; this script handled moving the
      positioner to a predetermined location, acting as a starting point or a recall after movement.
    </p></em>
  </div>

  <div class="software-images">
    <img src="MATLAB-moving.png" alt="MATLAB script for moving the nanopositioner">
  </div>

  <div class="software-text">
    <p>
      The next image is an extract from the logbook I kept during the placement. It shows two plots:
    </p>
    <p>
      Top – ‘Power vs Ticks’, this is the transmitted power through the optical setup against movement ticks
      (Due to how small the movement is, a true step size cannot be certain. A small voltage is applied that
      moves the positioner 1.7&nbsp;µm on average, each jolt of movement is called a ‘tick’)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bottom – ‘Transmissions ratio vs X’ this is a plot used to work out the maximum transmitted power we
      could expect based on the optical setup’s current state.
    </p>

<div id="software-linux" class="software-block-vertical">


  <h3>Linux (Operating System)</h3>

  <div class="software-text">
    <p>
      During my master’s project, the acquisition, manipulation, and cutting of data were performed within
      a Linux environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Data was obtained from NASA’s HEASARC Browser and then processed using HEASoft, a unified package for
      X-ray data analysis. Within the HEASoft environment, several key commands were run:
    </p>

    <pre class="linux-terminal">nicerL2 indir=OBSID clobber=YES</pre>
    <p>
      Runs NICER level-2 calibration that includes standard calibration, screening, and filtering of data.
    </p>

    <pre class="linux-terminal">xselect</pre>
    <p>
      Launches Xselect to allow reading in of events and application of key Ftools listed below.
    </p>

    <pre class="linux-terminal">set binsize 0.01</pre>
    <p>
      Sets the time bin size on the light curve, here 0.01 s. Smaller bin sizes yield more accurate
      representations of observed counts but introduce larger errors due to fewer counts per bin.
    </p>

    <pre class="linux-terminal">filter pha cut 30 1000</pre>
    <p>
      Applies an energy filter with lower (30) and upper (1000) cutoff, here corresponding to 0.3–10 keV
      (note: pha = pulse height amplitude). This filter removes photons outside of this energy range, which
      is standard practice for NICER observations of compact objects, as it ensures relevant data and reduces
      background noise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the raw data had been processed, the data was plotted to locate the area I was interested in
      (the burst). The data itself was an almost continuous acquisition from instruments onboard the
      International Space Station; the bursts had to be located manually.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once located, I cut down the data to just include the burst and prepared it for export to Python for
      modelling and analysis.
    </p>

    <p><em>
      Below is an example of what the data looks like after processing. The vertical line marks the burst.
      The Y-axis shows Rate as counts/s (think of this as energy being detected from the star). The X-axis
      is time in seconds – here we see ~20 hours of exposure.
    </p></em>

  <h2>Finance</h2>

  <!-- WHY FINANCE -->
  <h3>Why Finance, Not a Physics PhD</h3>
  <p>
Before settling on finance, I was on track to undertake a PhD in Physics. At the end of my time as a Research Assistant, a senior academic told me that if I was interested, he could create an opportunity under his supervision and that I would be “invited to apply”. I was also approached about a different PhD within the University; the professor running that project prefers to take on Southampton graduates, and my name had been suggested to him.  </p>
  <p>
In the end, I turned down both opportunities. My work in the university laboratories had exposed me to the day-to-day environment, and although it was mentally engaging, everything was extremely slow-paced. When you're working with expensive equipment, the slow and steady approach makes sense - but it just wasn’t the right fit for me.  </p>
  <p>
Having decided not to pursue a PhD, I started to evaluate my options. I looked at what skills I actually had, what kind of work genuinely interests me, and the sort of environment I wanted to be in. I knew I wanted something faster-paced, more applied, and ideally based in a big city like London. Once I looked at all of that together, finance became the obvious choice.  </p>
  <p>
The more I looked into the industry - and specifically analyst roles - the more it lined up with what I actually enjoy: analysing things, understanding how systems behave, spotting patterns, and making decisions based on data rather than guesswork. It’s fast-paced, intellectually challenging, and rewards people who think logically and learn quickly. Having experienced a real working environment first-hand at Invesco, I can confidently say that finance is the industry I want to work in.  </p>


  <div class="wavy-divider"></div>

  <!-- INITIAL PATH VS CURRENT MINDSET -->
  <h3>Initial ‘Path In’ vs Current Mindset</h3>
<ol style="line-height:1.55; padding-left:1.2rem;">

  <li><strong>Original Plan:</strong> <br>
    I started applying with a “foot in the door” approach: land a role anywhere in finance, demonstrate my work ethic, and then transition internally toward a more analytical position.  </li>

  <li><strong>Ebury Experience:</strong> <br>
    I landed an in-person interview for a Business Developer position at Ebury. In preparation, I researched FX markets, learnt and memorised their products, and kept up with current market events. That work helped me secure a final-round interview.
    I was ultimately rejected, but the feedback highlighted a few important things. In the final interview, they mentioned that I seemed far more interested in the research and analysis side of the role than the sales-heavy parts. They also questioned whether the position would keep me engaged long term.  </li>

  <li><strong>Turning Point:</strong><br>
    The experience made me reflect honestly on where my strengths lie and what kind of finance role I want to build a long-term career in. It became clear that a broad “foot in the door” strategy wouldn’t work - I needed to apply for roles I actually wanted and could excel in.
    I prefer working with data, markets, research, and analytical problem-solving - not sales. 
  </li>

  <li><strong>Mindset Shift:</strong><br>
    Rather than applying broadly, I now focus on roles that genuinely match my strengths and interests: analytical, research-driven, data-oriented positions. I want to be in an analyst role where I can apply my strengths.  </li>

  <li><strong>Steps Taken So Far:</strong>
      <ul style="margin-top:0.4rem;">
        <li>Built this website to showcase who I am and what I can do</li>
        <li>Rework my CV, highlighting my top strengths and skills.</li>
        <li>Start investigating finance projects I could independently undertake.</li>
        <li>Began applying only to roles I genuinely want</li>
        <li>Settled on a project with the working title "Monte Carlo Methods for Pricing Options"</li>
        <li>Created the 'Finance Glossary' to understand finance terminology (found under Projects tab)</li>
        <li>Continued my work on the Monte Carlo project</li>
      </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Current Mindset:</strong><br>
    I’m now focused on roles that match both my analytical strengths and my interest in financial markets - positions where quantitative reasoning, research, and problem-solving are core aspects of the work.
    It’s no longer about getting a “foot in the door”. I’m actively pursuing a path where I can excel.
